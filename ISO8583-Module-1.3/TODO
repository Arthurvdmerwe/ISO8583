Add:

	- create a unsetBit(bitNumber) method to delete a value of a bit inside the object
	
	- create a ISO8583Util Class that give some util method like:
		- intToBCD
		- BCDToInt
		- getTimeGMT (to bit 12)
		- GetDateType (to bit 13)

Fix:

	- ...

Think about:

	- Improve ... improve ... improve 
	
	- Add support to "BCD" sizes in LL LLL types.
		ASCII LL size and ASCII value inside '123456' ->  '06123456'
		BCD LL size and  ASCII value inside '123456' -> '\x06' + '123456'
		ASCII LLL size and ASCII value inside '123456' ->  '006123456'
		BCD LLL size and  ASCII value inside '123456' -> '\x00\x06' + '123456'
		
	- Improve support to "binary" data
		i.setBit(3,'\x00\x01\x02')
		
	- Make sense setBit(1,'xxx') ?	
		Maybe the dialet need to have the 2º bitmap inside with no value because it's automatic that 2º be present when bit large than 64 is inside... 
		But .. Today work :) by the way ... xxx is ignored...
		
	- It's important separate the size and the value of LL and LLL types?
		Example, bit 2 is LL:
			Today -> i.setBit(2,'123') -> i.getBit(2) -> 03123
			Think -> i.setBit(2,'123') -> i.getBit(2) -> 123
		It was build in this way because the size can be important in some cases, but we can determine the size len(i.getBit(2)) ...
		If the partner send a ISO8583 with wrong size?
		
	- Make a XML builder that convert a ISO8583 to a XML object and a XML to ISO8583...
		<ISO8583>
			<mti>0200</mti>
			<bitmap>600000000000000</bitmap>
			<bits>
				<bit>
					<number>2</number>
					<value>03123</value>
					<type>LL</type>
				</bit>
				<bit>
					<number>3</number>
					<value>300000</value>
					<type>N</type>
				</bit>
			</bits>
		</ISO8583>
		
	- Use log4Python to improve debug information
	
	- Support Python V3
	
	- Improve errors:
		- validate values
		
	- Improve the package name / structure
		- today: FROM ISO8583.ISO8583 import ISO8583
		- future: FROM iso8583 import ISO8583 
		
	- Create more examples

	- Create benchmarks with JPOS
	
	- Support EBCDIC ...
	
	- ...
